Here are all the personal projects I've created or worked on in my free time.

Stay tuned to see what I've made next!

# Technical

#### Zeta Score

Goal: prevent user accounts from participating in transactions with known/highly probable malicious accounts on the blockchain.

We believe that by determining a ***Zeta Score***, we can provide users metric for maliciousness so that they may determine whether they will transact with the account or not.

The plan is to analyze the blockchain transactional data and other sources in order to determine the ***Zeta Score***.


This project is a USC Dev Nights project, where USC students work throughout a semester to deliver a proof-of-concept to a panel of judges and investors.

<a href="https://aeged.github.io/decentralized-academic-repository" target="_blank">website</a>

A decentralized academic repository powered by blockchain aimed at disrupting the academic publishing industry.

Currently under development in a private repository (for the moment).

*Working draft* of the whitepaper available at the project website.

# Design

#### A-Team Logo

<div class="images showcase">
	<img src="../assets/icons/MyIcons/ateam-logo.png" height="150"/>
	<img src="../assets/icons/MyIcons/ateam-icon-light.png" height="150"/>
	<img src="../assets/icons/MyIcons/ateam-icon-dark.png" height="150"/>
</div>

This was a short branding project I did for a team I formed the summer of 2018.

My job was to conceptualize a logo and a statement of purpose for the team.

Our objective was to study blockchain technologies, so I took a lot of inspiration from the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) logo.
The idea started with a tall capital A, with it mirrored vertically with a smaller profile for the bottom "A".

My brain envisioned a nature inspired scene, a tall mountain with a lake reflecting it.
It metaphorically respresented the big things we hope to accomplish and the lasting effects we hope to leave (the huge reflection on the "lake").

#### Flask Logo

<div class="images showcase">
	<img src="../assets/icons/MyIcons/light-flask.png" height="150"/>
	<img src="../assets/icons/MyIcons/dark-flask.png" height="150"/>
</div>

This was a project I did one day for fun just to learn more Adobe Illustrator.

I made this logo for my own brand, mostly because I like the look of green Nickelodeon slime ðŸ˜‰.

The original name was "aeged labs", so the idea to use an erlenmeyer flask came naturally.
