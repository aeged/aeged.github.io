Lately, I've been doing a lot of interview prep with Python. I thought I'd compile some of my favorite useful tricks with Python to help out those in the same boat.

For those of you in that boat, keep swimmin' 🏊‍♀️ 🚣‍♀️ ✌️

## General Tricks

General tips:

- Always import specifically using `from x import y`
- Use the standard library as much as possible
- Write your code in functions

## Comprehensions

```python
s = 'hello world'
n = [i for i in range(len(s))]
d = {s[i]:n[i] for i in range(len(s))}
```
