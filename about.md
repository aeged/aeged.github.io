#### Intro

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alexander Gednov, and I am a Computer Science & Business Administration student at the [*University of Southern California* (USC)](https://www.usc.edu/).

I am passionate, curious, organized, industrious, ambitious, and action-oriented.
My inpiration stems from a passion for computers, business, finance, and design.
I'm always excited to meet or work with anyone who shares my passion and discover innovative solutions to profound problems.

One of my core characteristics is *curiostiy*. 

I definitely can't resist staying up all night learning new things.
Whether it's going through a watching a cool documentary, reading a technical article or economic news, or getting lost on wikipedia, I'm always looking to learn something new.

As such, I have an eclectic taste, and am passionate about a lot of things!
