Hello there!

My name is Alexander Gednov, and I am a Computer Science & Business Administration student at the *University of Southern California* (USC).

I am passionate, curious, organized, industrious, ambitious, and action-oriented.
My inpiration stems from a passion for computers, business, finance, and design.
I'm always excited to meet or work with anyone who shares my passion and discover innovative solutions to profound problems.
